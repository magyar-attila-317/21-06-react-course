### Kis történelem

Java - 1995 - Beta, 1996 - 1.0  
JavaScript - 1996 -> 1997 ECMAScript  
TypeScript - 2012 - Microsoft  
jQuery - 2006  
React - 2013 - Facebook

### [JavaScript](00-Intro/00-01-JavaScript.md)

### [ES6 new features](00-Intro/00-02-EcmaScript.md)

- let, const
- arrow functions
- classes, inheritance
- export/import
- spread operator
- destructuring

### [TypeScript](00-Intro/00-03-TypeScript.md)

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript which means it contains all features of it and may add extra functionality and/or
enhancements to it (inheritance, anyone?). Its greatest advantage is that it adds optional static typing to the
language. TypeScript gets compiled into JavaScript, so the browsers don't need to be prepared for another language.

## React Intro

### What IS ReactJs?

React.js is a JavaScript library (not a Framework!), developed by Facebook.

- It's main purpose is to solve issues, such as:
    - Updating our DOM dynamically
    - Managing a sort of state through-out our website
    - Give a desktop-application look-n-feel to our website, as
      an [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)
- https://reactjs.org/
    - Checking out its documentation and tutorials is highly recommended!
    - Available in other languages as well, but better stick to English :)
